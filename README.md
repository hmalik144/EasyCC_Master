# Easy CC

A simple and incredibily lightweight currency converter.
I created this app for private use but when it prevented me getting ripped off in Bali. I realised this can benefit many people.
This app also includes a home-screen widget which displays the current currency rate
of your choice, which updates every 3 hours.
